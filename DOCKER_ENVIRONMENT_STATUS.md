# Dzinza Microservices Audit - Documentation Review Summary

## Reviewed Documentation

### 1. Project Overview & Architecture

- **README.md**: High-level overview, service descriptions, setup instructions, and architecture summary.
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed technical architecture, service boundaries, data flow, technology stack, security, and deployment notes.

### 2. Environment & Configuration

- **docker-compose.yml**: Complete service topology, secrets, volumes, networks, healthchecks, and environment variable usage.
- **.env.example**: Comprehensive environment variable template for all services.
- **.secrets.baseline**: Baseline for secret management; explicit required secret files inferred from docker-compose.yml and .env.example.

### 3. Service-Specific Documentation

- **auth-service/README.md**: Patch for UserRole enum, migration script reference, and DB alignment notes.
- **docs/AUTH_SERVICE_OPENAPI_UPDATE.md**: Auth service API documentation, implemented endpoints, request/response formats, and planned features.

### 4. API Gateway & Routing

- **backend-service/app/services/proxy.py**: Version-agnostic routing logic, health check forwarding, header management.
- **backend-service/app/core/config.py**: Dynamic service mapping from config/services.conf and environment variables.

## Documentation Gaps Identified

1. **Service Discovery Config File**

   - The file `config/services.conf` is referenced for dynamic service URLs but was not found in the reviewed documentation. Its required format and example contents are not documented.

2. **OpenAPI/Swagger Specs**

   - While updates are described, the actual OpenAPI YAML/JSON files for each service (e.g., docs/openapi/paths/auth_paths.yaml) were not reviewed. These specs are critical for automated API testing and endpoint discovery.

3. **Database Schema Documentation**

   - No explicit documentation found for PostgreSQL or MongoDB schemas beyond code references and migration scripts. Schema diagrams or model documentation would aid in understanding data flow and integrity.

4. **Celery Worker Configuration**

   - The genealogy_service_worker setup is described in docker-compose.yml, but no documentation was found detailing its tasks, queue configuration, or monitoring.

5. **Monitoring & Observability**

   - Prometheus and Grafana are configured, but no documentation was found on dashboard setup, metrics endpoints, or alerting strategies.

6. **Frontend API Integration**

   - No documentation found describing how the frontend interacts with the API Gateway, authentication flows, or error handling.

7. **Secrets Directory Management**

   - The process for populating and rotating secrets in ./secrets/ is not documented beyond the baseline and references in docker-compose.yml.

8. **Feature Flags & Planned Features**
   - Feature flags are present in .env.example, but there is no documentation on their usage, impact, or rollout strategy.

## Codebase Analysis Summary

### Service Topology & Dependencies

- **Services:** frontend, backend_service (API Gateway), auth_service, genealogy_service (+ worker), search_service, storage_service.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (auth_service), MongoDB (genealogy_service, storage_service, search_service), Redis (auth_service, genealogy_service/Celery), Elasticsearch (search_service), S3-compatible storage (Garage cluster).
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Networks:** All services connected via `dzinza-network` (bridge).
- **Volumes:** Persistent volumes for databases, shared config, Garage storage.

### Environment Variable & Secret Management

- **Environment Variables:** Managed via root `.env` file and service-specific `.env` files. Variables are loaded using Pydantic Settings in each service.
- **Secrets:** Sensitive credentials (DB, Redis, JWT, SMTP, S3, etc.) are stored in individual files in `./secrets/` and mounted as Docker secrets.
- **Configuration Loading:** Services read secrets from files (preferred) or environment variables (fallback), with error handling for missing values.

### Dockerfile Build Processes

- **Backend Services:** Multi-stage builds with Python 3.11-slim, dependency installation, non-root users, healthchecks, and uvicorn entrypoints.
- **Frontend:** Node.js build stage for React app, Nginx for serving static assets, non-root user, healthcheck.
- **Best Practices:** All Dockerfiles follow security and production-readiness standards.

### Shared Resources

- **Volumes:** Used for database persistence, shared config, Garage S3 storage.
- **Networks:** Single bridge network for service communication.
- **Secrets:** Managed via Docker secrets and referenced in docker-compose.yml.

## Recommendations

- Add or update documentation for `config/services.conf` format and usage.
- Include OpenAPI/Swagger spec files for all services in docs/openapi/.
- Document database schemas and provide diagrams for key models.
- Add details on Celery worker configuration and monitoring.
- Provide guidance on Prometheus/Grafana dashboard setup and metrics.
- Document frontend-to-backend API integration and error handling.
- Clarify secret management procedures for development and production.
- Document feature flag usage and planned feature rollout.
