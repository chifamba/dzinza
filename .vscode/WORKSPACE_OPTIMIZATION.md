### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (.vscode/keybindings.json)

- `Ctrl+Shift+D` - Start full development environment
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` - Stop development environment
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` - Start backend service only
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` - Start frontend only
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Run all tests
- `Ctrl+Shift+W` - Frontend tests (watch mode)
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` - Lint all code
- `Ctrl+Shift+Y` - Type check all
- `Ctrl+Shift+G` - Check git status
- And more...

### 🐛 Debugging (.vscode/launch.json)

- Individual service debugging (Backend, Genealogy, Frontend)
- Test debugging for both frontend and backend
- Full-stack debugging compound configuration
- Proper TypeScript source map support

### 📚 Documentation (.vscode/TASKS_REFERENCE.md)

- Complete task reference guide
- Keyboard shortcut documentation
- Common workflow examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Customization instructions

## 🚀 Benefits

### ⚡ Productivity Improvements

1. **One-click development environment** - Start everything with a single task
2. **Keyboard-driven workflow** - Access common operations without mouse
3. **Service isolation** - Start only what you need for focused development
4. **Integrated debugging** - Debug TypeScript directly in VS Code
5. **Problem detection** - Automatic error highlighting and navigation

### 🔧 Developer Experience

1. **Consistent workflow** - Same commands work for all team members
2. **Self-documenting** - Tasks are clearly labeled and documented
3. **Error prevention** - Type checking and linting integrated into build process
4. **Quick recovery** - Easy database reset and service restart
5. **Git integration** - Common git operations accessible via tasks

### 🏗️ Workflow Optimization

1. **Parallel execution** - Multiple services can run simultaneously
2. **Background tasks** - Long-running services don't block the UI
3. **Clean terminals** - Dedicated panels for different operations
4. **State management** - Proper task cleanup and restart sequences

## 📊 Usage Statistics (Common Commands)

Based on project analysis, these are the most frequently used commands now optimized:

1. **Start development environment** - Used daily by all developers
2. **Frontend/Backend development** - Core development workflow
3. **Testing** - Used multiple times per day during TDD
4. **Linting/Type checking** - Pre-commit workflow
5. **Database operations** - Weekly for data management
6. **Git operations** - Daily for version control
7. **Building** - Used for deployment and CI/CD

## 🎯 Recommended Workflows

### 🌅 Daily Start

```
Ctrl+Shift+D (Start Full Development Environment)
→ Wait for services to initialize
→ Open browser to localhost:5173
→ Start coding!
```

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development

```
Ctrl+Shift+W (Frontend Tests Watch)
→ Write failing test
→ Write implementation
→ Watch tests pass
→ Ctrl+Shift+T (Run All Tests) before commit
```

### 📦 Pre-Commit Workflow

```
Ctrl+Shift+L (Lint All Code)
→ Ctrl+Shift+Y (Type Check All)
→ Ctrl+Shift+T (Run All Tests)
→ Ctrl+Shift+G (Check Git Status)
→ Commit changes
```

### 🗄️ Database Development

```
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D (Start Database Services)
→ Use 🗄️ Connect to PostgreSQL for queries
→ Use 🗄️ Reset Database when needed
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Team Onboarding**: Share TASKS_REFERENCE.md with new developers
2. **Customization**: Add project-specific tasks as needed
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Use task commands in build scripts
4. **Monitoring**: Track task usage to identify further optimizations
