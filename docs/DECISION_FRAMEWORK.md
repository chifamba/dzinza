# Decision Framework (Layer 0-4 Conflict Resolution)

## Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach for making decisions when rules from different layers conflict or when multiple valid solutions exist. It ensures consistent decision-making across all agents working on the Dzinza project.

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Identify the Context

#### Categorize the Decision Type
- **Safety/Security**: Affects user safety or system security
- **Architecture**: Affects system design or technology choices
- **Implementation**: Code-level decisions and patterns
- **User Experience**: Affects user interaction or interface
- **Performance**: Affects system speed or resource usage
- **Maintainability**: Affects code readability or future development

#### Assess Impact Scope
- **High Impact**: Affects multiple systems, many users, or is hard to change later
- **Medium Impact**: Affects single system or moderate user base
- **Low Impact**: Local change with minimal broader effects

#### Determine Urgency
- **Critical**: Security issue, production down, blocking release
- **High**: Important feature, performance issue, affects sprint goals
- **Medium**: Improvement, refactoring, nice-to-have feature
- **Low**: Documentation, minor optimization, future consideration

### Step 2: Apply Layer Hierarchy

#### Layer 0: Fundamental Laws (Never Override)
**Check**: Does this decision involve safety, security, legal, or ethical concerns?

- If YES: Apply Layer 0 rules strictly, no exceptions
- If NO: Continue to Layer 1

**Examples**:
- SQL injection vulnerability → Security first, fix immediately
- User data privacy → Apply GDPR requirements strictly
- Accessibility violations → Fix to meet legal requirements

#### Layer 1: Core Principles (Override only with explicit justification)
**Check**: Does this decision significantly affect user experience, security design, performance, maintainability, or accessibility?

**Decision Matrix**:
| Principle | High Priority When | Lower Priority When |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| User-Centric | User-facing features, UX changes | Internal tools, dev utilities |
| Security by Design | Authentication, data handling | UI components, formatting |
| Performance | User-facing operations | Admin tools, one-time scripts |
| Maintainability | Core business logic | Quick fixes, prototypes |
| Accessibility | Public interfaces | Internal dashboards |

**Conflict Resolution**:
- User safety > Performance > Maintainability
- Security > Convenience > Development speed
- Accessibility requirements are non-negotiable

#### Layer 2: Project Standards (Override with justification)
**Check**: Does this involve technology choices, architecture patterns, or development methodology?

**When to Override**:
- Performance requirements exceed standard patterns
- Third-party integration requires different approach
- Existing codebase constraints
- Team expertise limitations
- Time/budget constraints

**Override Requirements**:
- Document the specific standard being overridden
- Explain business/technical justification
- Plan future compliance if applicable
- Get team lead approval

#### Layer 3: Implementation Guidelines (Flexible with context)
**Check**: Does this involve coding standards, documentation, or review processes?

**Flexibility Factors**:
- Legacy code integration
- External library constraints
- Framework limitations
- Performance optimizations
- Team preferences

#### Layer 4: Style Preferences (Adapt to context)
**Check**: Does this involve formatting, naming, or organizational preferences?

**Context Considerations**:
- Existing codebase patterns
- Team consensus
- Tool limitations
- External dependencies

### Step 3: Evaluate Trade-offs

#### Trade-off Analysis Framework

```

Options: [List 2-3 viable options]

Option A: [Description]
├─ Pros: [Benefits]
├─ Cons: [Drawbacks]
├─ Risks: [Potential issues]
├─ Layer Alignment: [Which layers this supports/violates]
└─ Effort: [Implementation complexity]

Option B: [Description]
├─ Pros: [Benefits]
├─ Cons: [Drawbacks]
├─ Risks: [Potential issues]
├─ Layer Alignment: [Which layers this supports/violates]
└─ Effort: [Implementation complexity]

Recommendation: [Chosen option with reasoning]
```

#### Common Trade-off Scenarios

**Performance vs. Maintainability**
```
High Performance Needed:
├─ User-facing operations
├─ Real-time features
├─ Large-scale operations
└─ Choose: Performance-optimized solution

Maintainability Priority:
├─ Business logic
├─ Configuration management
├─ Error handling
└─ Choose: Clear, maintainable code
```

**Security vs. Usability**
```
Security Priority:
├─ Authentication flows
├─ Payment processing
├─ Admin functions
└─ Choose: More secure, potentially less convenient

Usability Priority:
├─ Public browsing
├─ Read-only operations
├─ Non-sensitive features
└─ Choose: User-friendly with adequate security
```

**Development Speed vs. Quality**
```
Speed Priority:
├─ Prototypes
├─ Time-critical fixes
├─ Proof of concepts
└─ Choose: Faster implementation, plan refactoring

Quality Priority:
├─ Core business logic
├─ Public APIs
├─ Security features
└─ Choose: Higher quality, longer development
```

### Step 4: Decision Documentation

#### Decision Record Template

```markdown
# Decision: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
- **Problem**: What decision needs to be made?
- **Impact Scope**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Urgency**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Affected Layers**: [List applicable layers]

## Decision
[Describe the chosen solution]

## Rationale
- **Layer Analysis**: How does this align with our layer hierarchy?
- **Trade-offs**: What were the key trade-offs considered?
- **Alternatives**: What other options were considered and why were they rejected?

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Benefits of this decision
- **Negative**: Drawbacks or technical debt created
- **Risks**: Potential future problems

## Implementation
- **Action Items**: Specific steps to implement
- **Timeline**: When this should be completed
- **Responsibility**: Who is responsible for implementation

## Review
- **Review Date**: When to revisit this decision
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure if this was the right choice
```

#### Quick Decision Log

For smaller decisions, use this simplified format:

```
