# Project Overview: Dzinza Genealogy Platform

## 1. Introduction

The Dzinza Genealogy Platform is an open-source, interactive platform designed to help users build their family trees, discover relatives, explore ancestral history, manage multimedia memories, and collaborate with family members.

## 2. Vision

To provide a comprehensive, user-friendly, and feature-rich environment for individuals and families to engage with their genealogical research and preserve their heritage for future generations.

## 3. Core Features (Initial Implementation Phase)

The initial development phase focused on delivering the following core capabilities:

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure registration, login, MFA, social logins, password management, and role-based access.
- **Family Tree Management:** Creation, visualization, and modification of family trees, including adding individuals, defining relationships (parents, spouses, children), and GEDCOM import/export.
- **User Profile Management:** Editable user profiles with avatar uploads and preference settings (notifications, privacy, theme).
- **Media Management:** Uploading, viewing, and managing photos, documents, and other media associated with individuals or families.
- **Stories & Events:** Creating and linking narrative stories or historical events to people in the family tree.
- **Collaboration & Sharing:** Inviting users to collaborate on family trees with varying permission levels.
- **Search & Discovery:** Comprehensive search functionality across the platform's data.
- **Admin Panel:** Tools for user management, site settings, and basic analytics.
- **Robust Backend & Infrastructure:** Microservices architecture, appropriate database choices (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), Elasticsearch for search, and containerization with Docker.
- **Observability:** Prometheus metrics and Jaeger distributed tracing integrated into backend services.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying services.

## 4. Implementation Plan & Status

The initial implementation plan, as detailed across 17 core workstreams in `JULES_TASKS.md`, covered the development of the features listed above.

-   **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Backend/Frontend (Workstreams 1-5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15)**
    -   Status: **✅ COMPLETED**
    -   Description: Included setting up DevOps, infrastructure, core backend services (auth, genealogy, storage, search), initial UI/UX design system, and core backend logic for user profiles, family trees, media, stories, collaboration, and search.
-   **Phase 2: Frontend Feature Implementation & Integration (Workstreams 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)**
    -   Status: **✅ COMPLETED**
    -   Description: Focused on building out the frontend UIs for authentication, family tree visualization and interaction, user profile management, media galleries and uploads, story/event creation and viewing, collaboration features, and search interfaces. This phase also included integrating these frontend components with their respective backend services.
-   **Phase 3: Admin Panel & Advanced Features (Workstream 17 and remaining tasks in others)**
    -   Status: **✅ COMPLETED**
    -   Description: Development of the admin panel, completion of GEDCOM import/export, advanced UI controls (e.g., tree zoom, date pickers for analytics), and finalization of observability and CI/CD deployment scripts.

**All milestones and phases within the initial implementation plan are now complete.** The platform has achieved its targeted feature set for this development cycle.

## 5. Technology Stack Summary

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript (Microservices)
-   **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
-   **Search**: Elasticsearch
-   **Storage**: Cloud-based (e.g., S3-compatible)
-   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes (target)
-   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 6. Future Development

While the planned initial scope is complete, future development could include:
-   Mobile applications.
-   Advanced DNA analysis features.
-   Deeper integration with historical record databases.
-   Enhanced AI-powered research suggestions.
-   Community-driven feature requests.

This document reflects the state of the project as of the completion of the initial 17 workstreams.
