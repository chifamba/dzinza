# Core Principles (Layer 1)

## Overview

These fundamental principles guide all decisions and implementations in the Dzinza project. They serve as the foundation for all other guidelines and should only be overridden in exceptional circumstances with explicit justification.

## Principle 1: User-Centric Design

### Definition
Every decision must prioritize the needs, goals, and experience of our users.

### Guidelines
- **User Research First**: Base decisions on actual user needs, not assumptions
- **Accessibility**: Design for users with diverse abilities and circumstances
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, intuitive solutions over complex ones
- **Performance**: Users' time is valuable - optimize for speed and efficiency
- **Privacy**: Respect user data and provide transparent controls

### Application Examples
- Choose faster loading times over flashy animations
- Prioritize mobile-responsive design
- Implement clear error messages and helpful feedback
- Provide export options for user data
- Use progressive disclosure for complex features

### Measurement
- User satisfaction scores
- Task completion rates
- Time to complete common actions
- Accessibility audit scores
- Performance metrics (load times, responsiveness)

## Principle 2: Security by Design

### Definition
Security is not an afterthought but a fundamental requirement integrated into every aspect of the system.

### Guidelines
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant events

### Application Examples
- Input validation on both client and server
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- HTTPS everywhere, no mixed content
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Secure session management and authentication

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization in place
- [ ] Data encryption configured
- [ ] Security headers set
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

## Principle 3: Performance & Reliability

### Definition
The system must be fast, reliable, and available when users need it.

### Guidelines
- **Performance Budget**: Set and maintain performance targets
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even when components fail
- **Scalability**: Design for growth
- **Monitoring**: Continuously track system health
- **Recovery**: Plan for failure and quick recovery

### Performance Targets
- Page load time: < 3 seconds on 3G
- Time to interactive: < 5 seconds
- API response time: < 200ms for common operations
- Uptime: 99.9% availability
- Error rate: < 0.1% of requests

### Implementation Strategies
- Lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Caching at multiple levels (browser, CDN, database)
- Database query optimization
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Principle 4: Maintainability & Clarity

### Definition
Code and systems must be understandable, modifiable, and sustainable over time.

### Guidelines
- **Clear Communication**: Code should tell a story
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established conventions
- **Documentation**: Keep docs current and useful
- **Modularity**: Build composable, reusable components
- **Technical Debt**: Address it proactively

### Code Quality Standards
- Self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Functions do one thing well
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Regular refactoring to improve design

### Documentation Requirements
- README files for all projects/modules
- API documentation with examples
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Migration guides for breaking changes

## Principle 5: Accessibility & Inclusivity

### Definition
The platform must be usable by people of all abilities, backgrounds, and circumstances.

### Guidelines
- **Universal Design**: Design for the widest range of users
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works everywhere
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper markup for meaning
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All features accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Compatible with assistive technologies

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Color contrast ratio â‰¥ 4.5:1
- Text scalable up to 200% without loss of functionality
- No content flashes more than 3 times per second
- All interactive elements focusable and labeled
- Multi-language support with proper RTL/LTR text direction handling
- Cultural sensitivity in design and content presentation

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Alt text for all images
- [ ] ARIA labels where needed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested
- [ ] Screen reader tested
- [ ] Color contrast verified
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Multi-language support implemented
- [ ] Language preferences stored and respected
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity reviewed

## Principle Application Framework

### Decision Making Process
1. **Identify affected principles**: Which principles apply to this decision?
2. **Assess trade-offs**: How do different options align with principles?
3. **Prioritize**: When principles conflict, which takes precedence?
4. **Document reasoning**: Explain why this choice best serves the principles
5. **Review impact**: How does this decision affect other system aspects?

### Conflict Resolution
When principles conflict:
1. **User safety** always comes first
2. **Security** generally trumps convenience
3. **Performance** vs **maintainability**: favor maintainability unless performance is critical
4. **Accessibility** requirements are non-negotiable
5. **Seek creative solutions** that honor multiple principles

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular principle review sessions
- Collect feedback on principle application
- Update examples based on real scenarios
- Measure principle adherence through metrics
- Celebrate principle-driven decisions

## Examples of Principle-Driven Decisions

### Database Design
- **User-Centric**: Design schema around user workflows, not technical convenience
- **Security**: Encrypt PII, implement row-level security
- **Performance**: Index frequently queried columns, normalize appropriately
- **Maintainability**: Use clear naming conventions, document relationships
- **Accessibility**: Support multiple languages and character sets

### API Design
- **User-Centric**: RESTful, predictable endpoints
- **Security**: Authentication required, rate limiting implemented
- **Performance**: Pagination for large datasets, efficient queries
- **Maintainability**: Versioned APIs, comprehensive documentation
- **Accessibility**: Support for multiple formats, clear error messages

### UI Components
- **User-Centric**: Consistent behavior, clear visual hierarchy
- **Security**: XSS protection, secure form handling
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, optimized images
- **Maintainability**: Reusable components, design system
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard support, color contrast

**Remember**: These principles are your north star. When facing difficult decisions, ask: "Which option best serves our users while maintaining security, performance, maintainability, and accessibility?"
