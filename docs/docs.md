# Dzinza Genealogy Platform - API Documentation

**Status: This section is being updated to reflect the new Python (FastAPI) based microservice APIs.**

## API Overview

The Dzinza backend API is now implemented as a set of Python microservices using the FastAPI framework. These services are fronted by an API Gateway (`backend-service`). All endpoints use JSON for request/response bodies and include standard HTTP status codes and error handling.

**API Gateway Base URL:** `/api/v1` (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/api/v1` if using default gateway port)

**Authentication:** Bearer token (JWT) is required for most endpoints. Tokens are issued by the `auth-service`.

**Service API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger):**
Each Python microservice exposes its own OpenAPI specification and Swagger UI:
-   **Auth Service:** Access its API docs via the gateway at `/api/v1/auth/docs` (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/docs`).
-   **Genealogy Service:** Access its API docs via the gateway (for relevant prefixes like `/family-trees`, `/persons`, etc.). For example, family tree docs might be conceptually at `/api/v1/family-trees/docs` (actual path depends on how gateway exposes aggregated docs or if direct service access is used for docs). Direct service OpenAPI is at `http://genealogy-service-py:8000/api/v1/docs`.
-   **Storage Service:** API docs via gateway at `/api/v1/files/docs`. Direct: `http://storage-service-py:8000/api/v1/docs`.
-   **Search Service:** API docs via gateway at `/api/v1/search/docs`. Direct: `http://search-service-py:8000/api/v1/docs`.

The legacy Node.js API documentation (`docs/api-swagger-legacy-node.yaml`) is available for historical reference only.

(Detailed endpoint documentation will now be sourced from these individual OpenAPI specs.)

# Authentication System Implementation Status

**Status: The Authentication System has been migrated to a Python (FastAPI) microservice (`auth-service`).**

## ✅ CORE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (Python `auth-service`)

### F1.1 User Authentication & Authorization

#### 🔧 Core Authentication Components
-   **User Registration:** Endpoint `/auth/register` for new user creation.
-   **Login:** Endpoint `/auth/login` for email/password authentication; handles MFA if enabled.
-   **JWT Issuance:** Issues access and refresh tokens upon successful login.
-   **Token Refresh:** Endpoint `/auth/refresh` to get a new access token.
-   **Email Verification:** Flow for verifying user email addresses.
-   **Password Management:** Endpoints for requesting password reset, and resetting password with a token. Authenticated users can change their own password.
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** TOTP-based MFA, including enablement, verification during login, and backup codes.
-   **User Profile (`/users/me`):** Authenticated users can retrieve and update their own profile information.
-   **Secure Password Storage:** Uses `passlib` with bcrypt for hashing passwords.
-   **Dependencies & Config:** Uses SQLAlchemy for DB interaction (PostgreSQL), Pydantic for validation, `python-jose` for JWTs.
-   **Audit Logging:** Structure for logging key authentication events.
-   **Admin User Management:** Basic admin endpoints for listing, viewing, updating, and deleting users (requires superuser role).

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (Python `auth-service`)

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens.
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt).
- HTTPS (assumed in production deployment).
- Input validation using Pydantic.
- Token expiry and refresh mechanisms.
- MFA (TOTP).
- Account lockout mechanism after failed login attempts.

### User Experience Features (Supported by Backend)
- Clear error messages for auth failures.
- Email-based flows for verification and password reset.
- Secure handling of sensitive user data.

### Developer Experience
- FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- Structured logging with `structlog`.
- Pydantic-based settings management.

## 🚀 PROJECT STATUS (Python `auth-service`)

The Python `auth-service` provides core authentication and user management functionalities, aiming for parity with the previous Node.js implementation and incorporating modern security best practices. Further testing and refinement are ongoing.

**Overview:** The Dzinza platform now utilizes a microservices architecture for its backend, implemented in Python using the FastAPI framework. A dedicated API Gateway service manages requests to the various downstream services.

**Key Components:**
-   **Frontend:** React (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS) - remains as is.
-   **API Gateway (`backend-service`):** Python (FastAPI), responsible for request routing, authentication (JWT validation), rate limiting, and forwarding to appropriate microservices.
-   **Authentication Service (`auth-service`):** Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis), handles user registration, login, JWT issuance, MFA, password management, user profiles.
-   **Genealogy Service (`genealogy-service`):** Python (FastAPI, Motor/MongoDB, Celery), manages family trees, persons, relationships, events, notifications, merge suggestions, and GEDCOM processing.
-   **Storage Service (`storage-service`):** Python (FastAPI, Motor/MongoDB, Boto3), handles file/media uploads, S3 integration, metadata, image processing, and cleanup.
-   **Search Service (`search-service`):** Python (FastAPI, Elasticsearch-py), provides search capabilities across platform data, logs search analytics.
-   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (for `auth-service`), MongoDB (for `genealogy-service`, `storage-service` metadata, `search-service` analytics), Redis (for `auth-service` caching/rate-limiting, Celery broker), Elasticsearch (for `search-service`).
-   **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose for containerization and local orchestration.
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds, linting, testing, and Docker image publishing.

(Further details on data flow, service interactions, and deployment will be added here.)
...

# Testing Strategy
(Content to be updated to reflect Pytest for backend, Vitest for frontend, and overall testing approach for the Python microservices.)

**Backend Testing (Python):**
-   **Unit Tests:** Pytest is used for unit testing individual functions, classes, and CRUD operations within each microservice. Mocks are used for external dependencies like databases or other services.
-   **Integration Tests:** Pytest with `TestClient` (for FastAPI) is used to test API endpoints within each service, mocking external service calls where necessary.
-   **Focus:** Business logic, data validation, API contract adherence, error handling.

**Frontend Testing (Vitest):**
-   (Existing Vitest setup remains for component and integration tests for the React frontend.)

**End-to-End Testing:**
-   (Conceptual) End-to-end tests will verify user flows across the frontend, API Gateway, and backend microservices. Tools like Cypress or Playwright could be used.

**CI Pipeline:** The GitHub Actions workflow includes steps for running linters (Ruff for Python) and Pytest for all backend services on pushes and pull requests.
