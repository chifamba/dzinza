As an experienced product owner and TPM, I've reviewed the features and capabilities of Ancestry.com and MyHeritage.com based on the provided sources. This analysis forms the foundation for a new genealogy platform tailored for the African context.

### Review of Ancestry.com and MyHeritage.com Functionality

Both Ancestry and MyHeritage offer robust platforms for family history research, each with distinct strengths:

**Ancestry.com Features & Workflows:**

- **Family Tree Building:** Offers **free family trees** accessible to anyone, serving as storage and research space. Users can build trees by entering personal details, parents, and grandparents.
- **Historical Records Access:** A core offering where subscriptions provide access to **60 billion records from 88 countries**, with rapid additions.
- **Pro Tools (Add-on Subscription):** Aimed at users with large trees, allowing deeper data analysis and new discoveries.
  - **Tree Views:** Includes **Pedigree (Horizontal)** and **Vertical** views (free to all). Pro Tools enhances the **Fan View** to show up to **seven generations** and includes **heat maps** for hints, photos, and sources.
  - **Charts & Reports:** Pro Tools enables generation of **Ancestor (on and toel) reports** (up to seven generations), **Descendancy reports**, **Register style**, and **Family group sheets**. These can be downloaded as PDFs for printing and sharing. Users can select a "focus person" for reports.
  - **Tree Mapper:** A powerful Pro Tool that visualizes **ancestral locations and journeys**. It allows filtering by direct line, paternal/maternal side, end of line, or floating people, and by specific events like births, marriages, deaths, or residence. The map can **zoom down to county level** in the US, providing insights into migration patterns. Standardized location data is crucial for its effectiveness.
  - **List of All People:** While a basic list is free, Pro Tools offers **advanced filters** by family line (direct, paternal, maternal, end of line, floating) and by **place and year ranges** (e.g., born in North Carolina between 1800-1825). This is valuable for focused research trips.
  - **Error Checker & Tree Rating:** Pro Tools identifies **possible duplicates**, people **with no sources**, or those with **only tree sources**. It helps users clean up their trees, with a **Tree Rating** (e.g., 7.0) indicating tree health.
  - **Enhanced Shared Matches (DNA Integration):** A Pro Tool that adds a third column to DNA shared matches, showing how much DNA your match shares with common matches, enabling powerful brick wall breakthroughs.
- **DNA Services:** Offers DNA testing for ethnicity results and matches, integrated with tree building.
- **Tree Tags:** A **free and powerful feature** allowing users to create custom tags for workflow, research statuses, and life experiences, which can be used to filter the list of all people.
- **GEDCOM Export:** Users can **download their family tree data as a GEDCOM file** for backup or transfer to other programs, though it **does not include images**.

**MyHeritage.com Features & Workflows:**

- **Family Tree Building:** Allows users to **quickly create a tree** by entering basic details.
- **Discoveries (Automated Matches):** This is a key differentiator.
  - **Instant Discoveries:** Can add an **entire new branch with photos in one click**.
  - **Smart Matches:** Connects a user's tree with **other MyHeritage users' trees**, enabling the discovery of new relatives (including side branches like aunts/uncles).
  - **Record Matches:** Reveals **historical records** (birth, marriage, death, census, gravestones, even Holocaust records) relevant to relatives, often providing matches "on a genealogical silver platter".
- **Review Process:** Presents user information alongside new match information for **side-by-side comparison** before acceptance.
- **DNA Services:** Offers autosomal DNA testing for ethnicity estimates and matches. Notable tools include a **Chromosome Browser** and a unique display of **shared matches**, showing DNA shared between your match and common matches.
- **Internal Messaging System:** Allows contact with DNA matches and family tree managers.
- **Charts & Books:** Provides various chart types (e.g., Fan Chart, Ancestors, Descendants) that can be generated for printing.
- **User Base:** Strong presence in **Europe and the US**, making it valuable for those with European lineage.

**Key Differences & Takeaways:**

- **Monetization:** Ancestry has a free tree with paid record access and an _add-on_ Pro Tools subscription, emphasizing depth for power users. MyHeritage is primarily subscription-based, with automated discovery as a core value proposition.
- **Discovery Philosophy:** MyHeritage focuses on automated, often "instant" discoveries to rapidly expand trees. Ancestry emphasizes hints that users review and attach, with Pro Tools providing advanced analysis for user-driven discovery.
- **Data Management:** Ancestry's Pro Tools provide sophisticated tools for managing large trees, checking errors, and visualizing data (maps, detailed filters). MyHeritage excels in surfacing new information through its matching algorithms.
- **DNA:** Both offer strong DNA tools, with similar "shared matches" functionalities designed to reveal deeper connections.

- **API-First Architecture:** Design the platform with a clear API layer to facilitate future integrations with other genealogy databases, local government archives, or educational platforms.

**For Rollout and Adoption Campaign:**

- **Pilot Programs with Community Champions:** Launch small, controlled pilot programs in select, diverse communities. Identify and empower local "champions" (e.g., community elders, local historians, teachers) who can become early adopters and advocates, training others within their trusted networks.
- **Grassroots Marketing & Awareness:** Leverage traditional communication channels popular in Africa, such as **local radio broadcasts**, community meetings (e.g., under a baobab tree), and **word-of-mouth campaigns**, alongside digital marketing on popular social media platforms. Use **culturally relevant imagery and narratives**.
- **Partnerships for Reach & Trust:**
  - **Telecom Operators:** Collaborate for **subsidized data bundles** or zero-rated access to the app, significantly reducing cost barriers for users.
  - **Educational Institutions:** Partner with universities and schools to integrate the platform into local history or social studies curricula, fostering early adoption among younger generations.
  - **Cultural & Heritage Organizations:** Work with local museums, historical societies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on heritage preservation to gain credibility and access existing networks.
  - **Local Governments & Traditional Leaders:** Secure endorsements from chiefs, elders, and local government bodies to build trust and legitimacy within communities.
- **"Train the Trainer" Model:** Develop structured programs to train local facilitators on how to use the app and conduct basic genealogical research, enabling them to cascade knowledge throughout their communities.
- **Regular Feedback Loops & Iteration:** Implement continuous feedback mechanisms, from in-app surveys to regular community workshops, demonstrating responsiveness to user needs and cultural sensitivities. This builds loyalty and ensures the product evolves meaningfully.
- **Gamification for Engagement:** Introduce elements like badges for adding generations, connecting new relatives, uploading oral histories, or solving "family mysteries" to encourage sustained engagement and contribution.
- **Defined Success Metrics & KPIs:** Track not just app downloads, but also active users, average tree size, number of oral history uploads, match confirmation rates, and the growth of family/clan groups. Qualitatively, measure stories of successful family connections and discoveries.
