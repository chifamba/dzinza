Repo Summary & Description
Repo Name: dzinza

Summary: An open-source, interactive genealogy platform for building family trees, discovering relatives, and exploring ancestral history.

Description:

Dzinza is a modern, feature-rich genealogy platform inspired by industry leaders like MyHeritage. It provides a suite of tools for users to build their family history, connect with relatives, and uncover the stories of their ancestors. The platform is designed with a mobile-first, responsive interface and a powerful backend to support a seamless user experience.

Key features include an intuitive family tree builder, DNA matching and analysis, a vast searchable database of historical records, AI-powered photo enhancement, and collaborative research capabilities. The project is built on a robust, scalable, and secure technology stack, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

Implementation Plan
This project will be implemented in five distinct phases, each with specific milestones and deliverables. The platform will be developed using a microservices architecture, containerized with Docker, and orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Backend
This initial phase focuses on establishing the project's foundation, including the development environment, core backend services, and database schemas.

Milestones:
Initialize Git repository and set up project structure.
Configure Docker and Kubernetes environments.
Design and implement database schemas for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
Develop core API endpoints for user authentication and data management.
Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Database Schema:
PostgreSQL:
users: Stores user profile information, authentication details, and preferences.
families: Manages family groups and associations.
individuals: Contains detailed information about each person in a family tree.
relationships: Defines the connections between individuals (e.g., parent, spouse, child).
MongoDB:
historical_records: Stores a wide range of historical documents, such as birth certificates, census records, and marriage licenses.
media: Contains metadata for user-uploaded photos, videos, and documents.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/auth/register: Creates a new user account.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
GET /api/users/:id: Retrieves a user's profile information.
POST /api/family: Creates a new family tree.
GET /api/family/:id: Fetches a family tree's data.
Phase 2: Frontend Development & Family Tree Builder
This phase concentrates on creating the user interface and implementing the core family tree functionality.

Milestones:
Develop the main application layout and UI components using React and Tailwind CSS.
Implement the family tree builder with drag-and-drop functionality using D3.js.
Integrate Redux for state management.
Ensure the UI is responsive and mobile-friendly.
UI/UX Wireframes:
Homepage: A clean, inviting design with a prominent call-to-action to start a family tree.
Dashboard: A personalized overview of the user's family tree, recent activity, and smart matches.
Family Tree View: An interactive, zoomable, and pannable interface for exploring the family tree.
Profile Page: A detailed view of an individual's profile, including photos, historical records, and family connections.
Phase 3: Advanced Features & Data Integration
This phase involves integrating advanced features, such as DNA matching, historical record search, and photo enhancement.

Milestones:
Implement DNA data upload and processing capabilities.
Develop a smart matching algorithm to identify potential relatives.
Integrate ElasticSearch for advanced historical record searching.
Use WebAssembly for client-side photo enhancement and colorization.
Core Feature Code (Conceptual):
JavaScript

// Smart Matching Algorithm
const findMatches = (user, potentialRelatives) => {
  return potentialRelatives.filter(relative => {
    const sharedSurnames = user.surnames.filter(surname => relative.surnames.includes(surname));
    const sharedLocations = user.locations.filter(location => relative.locations.includes(location));
    return sharedSurnames.length > 0 && sharedLocations.length > 0;
  });
};
Phase 4: Testing & Security
This phase is dedicated to ensuring the platform is secure, reliable, and performs well under load.

Milestones:
Conduct comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
Implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data.
Ensure GDPR compliance for user data privacy.
Perform security audits and penetration testing.
Testing Strategy:
Unit Testing: Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend components and backend services.
Integration Testing: Test the interactions between microservices and the database.
End-to-End Testing: Use Cypress to simulate user workflows and identify potential issues.
Phase 5: Deployment, Maintenance & Scaling
The final phase focuses on deploying the platform to production and establishing a plan for ongoing maintenance and scaling.

Milestones:
Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
Configure monitoring and logging using Prometheus and Grafana.
Implement a data backup and recovery strategy.
Develop a plan for scaling the platform as the user base grows.
Deployment Architecture:
Containerization: Dockerize all microservices for consistency and portability.
Orchestration: Use Kubernetes to manage and scale the containerized applications.
Cloud Provider: Leverage AWS for hosting, S3 for media storage, and other managed services.
Performance Optimization:
Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
Optimize database queries and indexes.
Implement lazy loading for images and other media.
Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets.
Maintenance & Scaling:
Continuously monitor application performance and user feedback.
Regularly update dependencies and patch security vulnerabilities.
Scale the application horizontally by adding more pods to the Kubernetes cluster as needed.
