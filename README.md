# Dzinza Genealogy Platform

An open-source, interactive genealogy platform for building family trees, discovering relatives, and exploring ancestral history. This platform provides tools for media management, storytelling, collaboration, and robust search capabilities.

**Current Project Focus: Backend Re-implementation with Python/FastAPI** Dzinza is undergoing a significant upgrade, migrating its backend services from Node.js to Python 3.11 and FastAPI. This strategic move aims to enhance performance, scalability, and maintainability. The existing React/Tailwind CSS frontend will be preserved and adapted. For details, please see our [Backend Migration Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Family Trees**: Build and visualize comprehensive family trees with advanced relationship mapping
- **DNA Analysis**: Upload and analyze DNA data from major testing companies (23andMe, AncestryDNA, MyHeritage)
- **AI-Powered Research**: Intelligent suggestions for family connections and historical record matching
- **Photo Management**: Advanced photo organization with facial recognition and automatic tagging
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share trees and research with family members in real-time
- **Historical Records**: Access to extensive historical databases and records
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular privacy settings to protect living relatives
- **Mobile Apps**: Full-featured iOS and Android applications (Planned)

## üèóÔ∏è Project Status

This project is **actively undergoing a significant backend migration from Node.js to Python (FastAPI)**. The frontend (React) will be preserved and adapted.

### Current Focus

- **Backend Migration**: Re-implementing backend services in Python 3.11 with FastAPI, as detailed in the [**Backend Migration Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)**](ROADMAP.md). This is the primary area for new development and contributions.
- **Frontend Adaptation**: Ensuring the React frontend integrates seamlessly with the new Python backend APIs.
- **Documentation Update**: Aligning all documentation (`docs/docs.md`, `README.md`) with the new Python-centric architecture and roadmap.

Refer to the [**Backend Migration Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)**](ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress and the phased approach.

## ü§ù Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions from the community! Given the ongoing backend migration, contributions aligning with the [**Backend Migration Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)**](ROADMAP.md) and the new Python stack are particularly valuable.

Please read our [Contributing Guide (within docs/docs.md#contributing-guide)](docs/docs.md#contributing-guide) and [Code of Conduct (within docs/docs.md#code-of-conduct)](docs/docs.md#code-of-conduct) before getting started.

### Ways to Contribute

- üêõ Report bugs and issues (especially related to the new Python services or frontend integration).
- üí° Suggest new features (aligning with the Python migration and overall project vision).
- üìù Improve documentation in [docs/docs.md](docs/docs.md) (updates related to the Python backend, new services, and architectural changes are highly encouraged).
- üîß Submit code improvements (Python backend services, frontend adaptation to new APIs, shared libraries).
- üß™ Help with testing the new Python services and their integration with the frontend.

## üß™ Testing

The project uses Vitest for frontend testing. For more information on the test setup, see:
