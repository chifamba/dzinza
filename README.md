- **Search & Discovery**: Powerful search across individuals, families, stories, and media, with filtering and sorting options, powered by Elasticsearch.
- **Admin Panel**: Dashboard for user management, site settings, basic analytics (including user sign-up and content creation trends with date filtering), and system health monitoring.
- **Secure & Scalable Backend**: Microservices architecture with services for authentication, genealogy, storage, search, and a gateway. Uses PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics and Jaeger distributed tracing integrated into backend services.
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for testing, building, and deploying services.
