# Dzinza Genealogy Platform

An open-source, interactive genealogy platform for building family trees, discovering relatives, and exploring ancestral history. This platform provides tools for media management, storytelling, collaboration, and robust search capabilities.

**Documentation Structure:**

- **/docs**: Project documentation (overview, environment, architecture, API references).
- _(Other specific documentation links can be added here as they are updated)_

For a full table of contents and access to all documentation, see the main [Project Documentation Hub (docs/docs.md)](docs/docs.md).

**Project Status: Backend Migrated to Python/FastAPI**
The Dzinza platform's backend has been successfully migrated from Node.js to a modern Python 3.11+ stack, primarily using FastAPI for its microservices. This migration enhances performance, scalability, and maintainability. The React/Tailwind CSS frontend remains and now interacts with these new Python backend services.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Family Trees**: Build and visualize comprehensive family trees with advanced relationship mapping
- **DNA Analysis**: Upload and analyze DNA data from major testing companies (23andMe, AncestryDNA, MyHeritage)
- **AI-Powered Research**: Intelligent suggestions for family connections and historical record matching
- **Photo Management**: Advanced photo organization with facial recognition and automatic tagging
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share trees and research with family members in real-time
- **Historical Records**: Access to extensive historical databases and records
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular privacy settings to protect living relatives
- **Mobile Apps**: Full-featured iOS and Android applications (Planned)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/dzinza/dzinza.git`
3.  **Navigate to Project**: `cd dzinza`
4.  **Environment Setup**:
    *   Copy the root `.env.example` to `.env` and customize Docker Compose variables (ports, common DB user/pass if not using secrets, etc.).
    *   Populate the `./secrets/` directory with actual secret files as listed in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `db_password.txt`, `jwt_secret.txt`). Refer to `.secrets.baseline` for a list of required secret files.
    *   Individual Python services load their specific settings via Pydantic-Settings, which can also utilize `.env` files within their service directories if needed for local overrides during development (though Docker Compose environment variables and secrets are primary for containerized setup).
5.  **Build & Start Services**: `docker-compose up -d --build` (use `--build` for the first time or after code changes).
6.  **Access Frontend**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://dzinza.local` if you have set up local DNS and Traefik is configured accordingly in your Docker Compose setup for local development).
7.  **API Documentation**: Each Python backend service (auth, genealogy, storage, search) exposes its OpenAPI documentation at `/api/v1/openapi.json` and interactive Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs`. The API Gateway (`backend-service`) proxies requests to these services under `/api/v1/<service-prefix>/...`.

## ÔøΩüìö Documentation

All project documentation is centralized in [**docs/docs.md**](docs/docs.md). This comprehensive document includes:

- **User Guides**: User Manual, Quick Start, Installation.
- **Developer Documentation**: System Architecture (reflecting Python microservices), Development Guidelines (Python/FastAPI focused), Testing Strategy (Pytest for backend, Vitest for frontend), Contributing Guide.
- **Operational Guides**: Deployment (Python microservices with Docker Compose), Infrastructure, Monitoring, Admin Guide.
- **Project Information**: Project Overview (updated for Python migration), API Documentation (links to individual service OpenAPI specs), Database Schemas (PostgreSQL & MongoDB for Python services), Code of Conduct.

Key documents and sections to highlight:

- [Project Documentation Hub (docs/docs.md)](docs/docs.md) - Your central starting point for all documentation.
  - **API Documentation**: Each Python service (Auth, Genealogy, Storage, Search) provides its OpenAPI specification at `/api/v1/openapi.json` and interactive Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs`. These are accessible via the API Gateway (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/docs`). The legacy `api-swagger.yaml` in the `docs` folder is now outdated.
  - [Development Guidelines (Python Backend)](docs/docs.md#development-guidelines) - _To be updated for Python focus._
  - [System Architecture Overview](docs/docs.md#system-architecture-overview) - _To be updated to reflect Python microservices._
  - [Contributing Guide](docs/docs.md#contributing-guide)
- The [Backend Migration Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)](docs/markdown/legacy/ROADMAP.md) is now primarily for historical reference as the migration is complete.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Status

The backend services for the Dzinza platform have been successfully migrated to Python 3.11+ using the FastAPI framework. This includes the Auth, Genealogy, Storage, Search, and API Gateway services. The frontend (React) remains and now communicates with these new Python APIs.

### Current Focus

- **Service Hardening & Testing**: Enhancing test coverage (unit, integration, e2e) for all Python backend services.
- **Feature Parity Refinement**: Ensuring all functionalities from the previous Node.js backend are fully operational and optimized in the Python versions.
- **Documentation Finalization**: Completing updates to all project documentation to reflect the new Python-based architecture.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing any performance bottlenecks in the new services.
- **Preparing for Next Development Cycle**: Planning new features and enhancements on top of the new Python backend.

The original [Backend Migration Roadmap (ROADMAP.md)](docs/markdown/legacy/ROADMAP.md) can be consulted for historical context, but the primary migration effort is complete.

## üß™ Testing

The project uses Vitest for frontend testing. For more information on the test setup, see:

- [VITEST_MIGRATION.md](frontend/VITEST_MIGRATION.md) - Detailed migration guide from Jest to Vitest
- [VITEST_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md](frontend/VITEST_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md) - Quick summary of the migration status

### Running Tests

**Frontend (Vitest):**
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test # Or specific Vitest command if configured e.g., npm run test:vitest

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch # Or specific Vitest command

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage # Or specific Vitest command
```

**Backend (Pytest):**
For each Python backend service (e.g., `auth-service`, `genealogy-service`):
```bash
# Navigate to the service directory
cd <service-name> # e.g., cd auth-service

# Ensure Python virtual environment is active and dev dependencies (pytest) are installed
# (Typically managed by poetry or pip install -r requirements-dev.txt if you have one)

# Run pytest
pytest
```
The CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/dzinza.yml`) is configured to run Pytest for all Python services.
